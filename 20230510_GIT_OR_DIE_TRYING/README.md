# GIT or Die Trying

OK Jack. The first thing you should probably learn is how to use Git and GitHub.

I recommend that you complete these tasks using your Ubuntu setup (of the Ubuntu machine in the office). An MWS machine isn't going to cut the mustard.

So, here are your marching orders:

## Tasks

1. Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one).
2. Fork this repo.
3. [Configure your ssh](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
3. Use bash to clone your forked repo (use the ssh link) to your local machine.
4. Complete to coding challenge in the `challenge.py` file.
5. Commit your changes locally.
6. Push your commit to your GitHub repo.
7. Make a pull request via your repo to incorporate your changes into the upstream repo.
